        <article>
            <p>MicroStrategy, now officially rebranded as Strategy, reported a significant $670 million impairment loss in Q4 2024, primarily due to Bitcoin valuation shifts. Despite this, the company continues to aggressively accumulate BTC, reinforcing its long-term confidence in the asset.</p>
            
            <h2>Why the Rebrand?</h2>
            <p>On February 5, Strategy introduced its new name and a redesigned logo featuring a stylized "B," symbolizing its deep connection to Bitcoin. The announcement coincided with its fourth consecutive quarterly loss and a heightened focus on BTC investment.</p>
            
            <h2>Q4 Earnings Breakdown</h2>
            <p>The company reported a net loss of $670.8 million, equating to $3.03 per share, a stark contrast to the $89.1 million profit from the previous year. The loss was largely due to a $1.01 billion impairment charge on Bitcoin holdings, a substantial increase from last year’s $39.2 million.</p>
            
            <p>However, starting Q1 2025, new fair-value accounting rules will allow the company to report Bitcoin's real-time market value, potentially stabilizing earnings volatility.</p>
            
            <h2>Bitcoin Accumulation Continues</h2>
            <p>Despite the financial setback, Strategy remains committed to its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. In Q4 alone, the firm made its largest Bitcoin purchase ever, adding 218,887 BTC valued at $20.5 billion. As of now, the company holds 471,107 BTC, estimated at around $46 billion.</p>
            
            <h2>Stock Performance and Investor Sentiment</h2>
            <p>Strategy’s stock saw significant growth in 2024, climbing nearly five-fold and securing a place in the Nasdaq 100. However, investor response to the latest earnings was mixed, with shares dropping 3.33% to $336.7 on February 5. Year-to-date, the stock remains up over 12%.</p>
            
            <h2>Shifts in Financing Approach</h2>
            <p>Looking ahead, Strategy plans to emphasize fixed-income financing, including convertible bonds and preferred stock, to sustain its Bitcoin investment. The firm aims to raise $42 billion within three years, with $20 billion already secured.</p>
            
            <p>Meanwhile, a slight deviation from its usual Bitcoin purchasing strategy was observed, as the company refrained from selling shares to finance BTC acquisitions between January 27 and February 2, marking the first such pause in 12 consecutive weeks.</p>
